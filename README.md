# Arduino Bluetooth-Controlled Car – Custom PCB

This repository contains a fully customized Bluetooth-controlled car project designed by **Daham Sathmin (OS Daham)**. It integrates a clean and compact **custom PCB layout**, removing the complexity of jumper wires while enhancing performance and assembly.

## 🔎Project Overview

Built on the Arduino platform, this robotic car is controlled wirelessly via a Bluetooth module (HC-05/HC-06). The code interprets character commands from a mobile app and drives motors through an L298N motor driver.
This version includes a **professionally routed PCB** that simplifies connections and improves long-term reliability — ideal for students, DIYers, and robotics enthusiasts.


## 📋Repository Contents

- `Arduino_BT_Controlling_Car_PCB.ino` – Complete Arduino sketch for car control  
- `Gerber_Arduino-Bluetooth-Controlling-Car-PCB.zip` – Custom PCB Gerber files designed by OS Daham


## 🔑Key Features

- Bluetooth-based control via smartphone  
- Compact, easy-to-assemble PCB design  
- Modular code structure for easy customization  
- Supports Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop and Lights & Horn commands  
- Clean hardware layout ideal for robotics kits and classroom use

## 📦Getting Started

1. **Upload the Sketch**  
   - Open `Arduino_BT_Controlling_Car_PCB.ino` in Arduino IDE  
   - Select board and COM port, then upload the code

2. **Assemble the Hardware**  
   - Solder the components to the custom PCB  
   - Connect motor driver, Bluetooth module, motors, and power supply

3. **Mobile Bluetooth Control**  
   - Pair phone with HC-05 (default PIN: `1234`)  
   - Use any Bluetooth controller app  
   - Send the following character commands:
     - `F` – Forward  
     - `B` – Backward  
     - `L` – Left  
     - `R` – Right  
     - `S` – Stop
     - `W` – Front Light on
     - `w` – Front Light off
     - `U` – Back Light on
     - `u` – Back Light off
     - `X` – Extra Light on
     - `x` – Extra Light off
     - `V` – Horn on
     - `v` – Horn off

## ⌛️PCB Design

This version includes a **custom-designed PCB layout** created specifically for this Bluetooth-controlled car project. You can use the Gerber files to fabricate your own professional board.

**📁Gerber Download:**  
[`Gerber_Arduino-Bluetooth-Controlling-Car-PCB.zip`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F9R93RxTxxKxCy0Tvj5duxJRR05ZcWrq/view?usp=sharing) 

**📌How to Use:**
- Upload the `.zip` file to a PCB manufacturer like:
  - [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)
  - [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com)
  - [Seeed Fusion](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion.html)
- Recommended specs: 2-layer, 1.6mm thickness, HASL finish



## 💡Advanced Customization Ideas
